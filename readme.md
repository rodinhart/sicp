In this repo I will go through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (2nd edition) and try to complete all the exercises. In order to run the examples in the book and complete the exercises, I will implement a Scheme evaluator in JavaScript. Features will be added as needed to complete the book. Near the end I will implement Scheme in C compiled to WebAssembly, i.e. wasm will play the part of the register machine.
